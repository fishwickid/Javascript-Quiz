# Javascript-Quiz

The Javascript Quiz App.

This application is to test your knowledge about Javascripts. 

First you are prompted to start the game by clicking the start button. 
The HTML section of this page is quite bare as I have just made a skeleton of the questions and pulled them through using getElementById on the javascript side

From there you will be prompted to answer 5 questions in 30 seconds...

These questions are all definied in the javascript and I've made a "renderProgress" function which loops through all the questions. This will go until the last question... or until the time is up and then send you to the score page
